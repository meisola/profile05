      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Brief:</strong>
        Expense tracking app designed to help people achieve saving goals.
      <p>
        <strong>My role: </strong>
        UI, UX, design system, prototype.
      <p>
        <strong>Our Problems: </strong>
        My friends and I have tried some app to help us tracking our spending, but some of them are too complex to use
        with many functions that we don’t need or some are easy to use but can’t fulfil our requirements.
      <p>
        <strong>General Problems: </strong>
        Expense tracking would be the first step to manage personal finance. However, people often stop recording their
        spending after start tracking their expense for a while.
      <p>
        <strong>Design opportunity: </strong>
        To design an expense tracking app that provide “just right” functions with simple to use system.
      <p>
        <strong>Design solution: </strong>
        Based on the research, we designed a goal function to help people achieve their saving goal.
      <p>
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <img src="process.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We first looked into <span style="color:#5896A3;">our experience</span>. We all have experience in doing expense
        tracking. Hence, we noticed some pain points while using expense tracking app and keep recording. </p>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Target Audience</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          People aged 18 to 28 with simple finance status and want to start understand their expense. Initial target
          market: Taiwan
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Interview</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          We tried to conduct interview to <span style="color:#5896A3;">gather deeper insight</span> about the topic.
          The interview questions sought to collect information about people’s expense tracking experience, habits,
          tools and pain points. By designing the questions, I apply the <span style="color:#5896A3;">golden circle
            approach</span> to discover more detail information.
        <p>
          <img src="question.png" alt="">
        <p>

          After collected the information, we first do initial coding to reduce and organise with the data for later
          research. We tried to find out rich information in the conversation by analysing the cleaned data. We found
          that forgetfulness, laziness and missing receipt happened in most of our interviewees. People sometime did not
          even know the why they tracking their spending or how to deal with those the report of their finance.
          Sometimes people may just track their expense because they think it might improve their finance status. <span
            style="color:#5896A3;">I learn that lack of motivation would be central issue that cause people often give
            up tracking their spending</span>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <img src="coding.png" alt="">
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Competitive Analysis</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          We started this process to understand those similar products in Taiwan. I also read some case study form
          internet to study more information. With those analysis I can have a chance to see what features work well and
          what are not. Also, I am able to <span style="color:#5896A3;">spot the common design patterns</span> that
          users may be used to. Then, we can figure out something to learn and improve when developing our app.
        <p>
          When studying some money tracking app in Taiwan, we listed some main features. From the analysis, most app
          provide a main feature is to give users graph to visualise their finance. Some of them provide extremely
          simple function, only recording expense and show pie chart of spending. Some can connect with bank to syne
          users’ card, so that they don’t need to input every item they purchase. These both <span
            style="color:#5896A3;">tend to make the recording process as easy as possible</span>. However, only one
          product tried to help user keep their tracking habit by gamification.
        <p>
          To sum up, many apps try to cut down the time expense tracking cost, so users can input their spending
          quickly, conveniently and simply. But, few apps focus on helping people to keep the habit and achieve their
          financial purpose.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        I created personas base on the interview data to help us focus on target users through the whole develop
        process. In the two personas, they cover our target users setting. One is university student who want to save
        money for new smartphone. The other is a junior engineer who wants to save some salary every month for future
        use.
      </p>

    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <h2>Establish Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        We focus on our target users and previous research to develop some key features.
      </p>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Goal</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          By setting a goal, people can be motivate to achieve and control their spending. In this case, we will help
          users to reach their goal by calculate their daily budget.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Project</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          Create a project can help users better to manage and categorise their expense. Also, users can set a limit
          expense for the project to help them control their finance on various purpose.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Just Right</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          We provide no more and no less function, so that users can have enough functions but easy to learn system.
          Fully functional app may be too complex for first time users or expense-tracking beginner. Hence, we give just
          enough function with lower threshold.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        After deciding on key features that may help users. I sorted those information form research to structure the
        product. I built several versions to see which would work more logically. Each category in the picture below
        would become a tab in the navigation bar.
      </p>
      <img src="ia.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Based on the information architecture, I sketched some wireframe to see if the system works. Those wireframes
        would help guide later stage design and interaction.
      </p>
      <img src="wire.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Wireframes prototype</h2>
      <p>
        I created the prototype with high-fidelity wireframes to test the whole system. With the prototype, we can see
        if the user flow works smoothly. We discuss every page, so that I can do a fast test with my partner and
        discover the design may not be useful.

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Design System</h2>
      <p>
        I created the design system to identify the visual guidelines for this project. Also, this can help our team
        develop the product easier.
      </p>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Typography</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          Our target market is Taiwan, hence, Mandarin and English are both needed for our users.

      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Colours</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          Finance may be a serious topic for some people, therefore, we tried to communicate with users gently without
          giving them intensive experience. I applied various colours saturation to give users different feeling. <span
            style="color:#5896A3;">I used softer colour to present income and expense to decrease stress when see the
            expense</span>. On the other hand, I used cheering colours on goals and projects, so that it may courage
          users on achieving their goals.

      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Icon Set</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          I created the icon set for users to select when categorising their expense and to let the system more
          consistent. Not only the default category icons be created, but also several icons made for users to establish
          custom category.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Current Design</h2>
      <p>We have completed our UI design and now stepping into evaluation stage. </p>
      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Goal System</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          The goal function aims to help users save money by telling them their daily budget. We tell users how much
          they can spend instead of how much they need to save, so that users only need to stay with in budget. If users
          are over budget, the budget next day will be cut down, in contrast, if users spend less than the budget, they
          will get more budget next day.
        <p>
          After users achieve the goal, a congratulations message will sent to users to congrats on their success. The
          purpose of this is trying to boost users’ sense of achievement and share their joy.
        </p>

      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Project System</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          By creating projects, users can set a limit expense to help them control their spending in different
          situation. For example, users can create a project for recording their spending when going on a trip, so that
          recording in project will sperate from other expense. In the project setting, I use the words “limit expense”
          not “budget” because budget may cause people misunderstand if the budget is related to their income or not. To
          avoid this confusion, “limit expense” is applied to make users understand the function clearly.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="learn" style="margin-top: 0px;">

      <div class="part">
        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Main Page</strong>
        <p>
          <br>
          Different form most expense tracking app, we do not set the recording page as the main page. To make users
          first to see the information of their daily budget, I set main page to present this data, also, notification
          of daily budget will be sent. Moreover, on-going goals and projects will be show in the main page as well. In
          order to let users record their expense easily and swiftly, a fixed button is provide as a shortcut to record.
        </p>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Design system and collaborate:</strong>
        At first, we did not thinking about building a visual guideline. However, after few times meeting with another
        designer, I thought it might be better to have a design system to help us. With the simple system, my partner
        can apply the guideline on design, so that our design can be more consistent. It can also help us communicate
        and collaborate.
      <p>
        <strong>Breaking down the problems:</strong>
        We were just thinking to make a simple-to-use app at the beginning. After gain deeper insight of problem, we
        found more details through the research. Then, we can make a better design decisions based on research.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Next Step</h2>
      <p>
        We are now carrying out usability test to evaluate our design. At the same time, developer starts coding the
        structure of app.
